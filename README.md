# aivengine-opentk
OpenTK Engine class for aivengine

This is an hardware accelerated implementation of the Aiv.Engine.Engine class.

It contains a fixed-pipeline and a shader-based Engine class you can use in place of the default aivengine one.

Work on simple Mesh support is on work (with diffuse basic lighting and texturing).
